Create an express app and build API routes
 
- APIs should fetch data from a url which is "http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.gz"
which is .gz file
 
- make (two) api route in node js (express/nestjs/framework) which can do the following things
 
0. create api routes like "/api/packages"
1. download file from this url http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.gz
2. extract .gz and save file on server file system
3. read the extracted file and return data in response
 
- make second api route in node js taking package name as query param
0. create api routes like "/api/package?name=packageName"
1. Now we have downloaded file content on server from above api call
3. search for the package name and return data from the file for the package "packageName"
 
Note - sample content of the file after extract
